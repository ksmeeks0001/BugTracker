# BugTracker
Software Development tool for tracking issues.

As an Administrator, add Project Managers and Developers to your team and create new Development projects.

The Project Manager will assign developers to the project and assign a developer to open issues on the project. 

All members of the team can add issues to projects in which they are a part of and track progress towards 
resolution by adding notes to an issue. Issues are marked resolved when completed and removed from the open 
Issues page.
